## What is Claw Sama?

Claw Sama is an AI desktop pet built as an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/anthropics/openclaw) plugin. She lives on your desktop as a 3D VRM avatar, talks to you with voice, reacts with emotions, and even watches your screen to keep you company.

## Features

### VRM Avatar
- 3D VRM model rendered with Three.js
- Facial expressions & emotion system (happy, sad, angry, surprised, think, curious...)
- Idle animations with random fidgets
- Mouse/camera gaze tracking
- Lip-sync synchronized with TTS audio

### AI Conversation
- Chat via text input or voice (hold F10)
- LLM-powered responses with personality (configurable via SOUL.md & IDENTITY.md)
- Emotion tool — AI controls avatar expressions in real-time
- One-click persona generation from avatar screenshot

### Screen Observation
- Captures your desktop every 60 seconds
- AI recognizes what you're doing and interacts accordingly
- Playing games? She cheers you on
- Writing code? She reminds you to rest
- Watching videos? She comments on the content
- Toggle on/off in settings

### Text-to-Speech
- Edge TTS (free, multiple Chinese/English/Japanese voices)
- Qwen TTS (Alibaba Cloud, expressive voices)
- Volume control & voice preview

### Desktop Integration
- Always-on-top transparent window
- Click-through when not interacting
- Drag to move, rotate camera, zoom
- Pin/unpin, hide/show
- macOS & Windows native support
